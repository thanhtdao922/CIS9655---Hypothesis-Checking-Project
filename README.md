# CIS 9655: Hypothesis Checking Project

Nintendo has been a dominant force in the gaming industry for decades, consistently delivering innovative and beloved titles that have shaped modern gaming. But what defines the best Nintendo game, and which platforms have been the most popular? 

This analysis explores these questions using data-driven insights through Python and Excel, focusing on the following five major franchises: 

- [Super Mario](https://mario.nintendo.com/)
- [Pokemon](https://www.pokemon.com/us)
- [Fire Emblem](https://www.nintendo.com/jp/fe/en/index.html?srsltid=AfmBOopIqiB-OpY74MsAijppaZJLqoTD9p7_H6ttu0bKuggqaWHgzzrE)
- [Kirby](https://kirby.nintendo.com/)
- [The Legend of Zelda.](https://zelda.nintendo.com/)

We hypothesize that The Legend of Zelda will emerge as the top franchise based on our criteria, with the [Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/us/switch/?srsltid=AfmBOoqy4e_SrPyEjUYQY7f60RCPV-_shS4iRFc-I41ka3ubf3Qp4_jD) being the best performing platform. 

After our analysis, we found our hypothesis was partially incorrect. Pokemon emerged as the top franchise, and the Nintendo Switch was proven to be the best performing platform.
